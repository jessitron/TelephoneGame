greenDAO observations so far:

 - no option for default timestamp
 - doesn't create key with autoincrement, and requires ID for instantiation! like I care what the ID is!
 - will not give me a cursor to create the simpleCursorAdapter
 - there is a queryBuilder that lets you add sorts, joins, where clauses, abstracted from SQL

 Big Q: how the fuck am I supposed to know the next game ID?
