greenDAO observations so far:

 - no option for default timestamp
 - doesn't create key with autoincrement, and requires ID for instantiation! like I care what the ID is!
 - will not give me a cursor to create the simpleCursorAdapter
 - there is trickiness in one-to-manys, getting the list updated correctly in the session

 - there is a queryBuilder that lets you add sorts, joins, where clauses, abstracted from SQL
 - transactions take place in Runnables or Callables, obtained from the session
 - joins are lazy-loaded by default but can be triggered as eager, in which case they use one SQL statement
